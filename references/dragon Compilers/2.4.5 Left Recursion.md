### 2.4.5 Left Recursion

It is possible for a recursive-descent parser to loop forever. A problem arises with “left-recursive” productions like

```fsharp
expr -> expr + term
```

where the leftmost symbol of the body is the same as the nonterminal at the head of the production. Suppose the procedure for `expr` decides to apply this production. The body begins with `expr` so the procedure for `expr` is called recursively. Since the lookahead symbol changes only when a terminal in the body is matched, no change to the input took place between recursive calls of `expr`. As a result, the second call to `expr` does exactly what the first call did, which means a third call to `expr`, and so on, forever.

A left-recursive production can be eliminated by rewriting the offending production. Consider a nonterminal `A` with two productions

```fsharp
A -> A α | β
```

where `α` and `β` are sequences of terminals and nonterminals that do not start with `A`. For example, in

```fsharp
expr -> expr + term | term
```

nonterminal `A = expr`, string `α = + term`, and string `β = term`.

The nonterminal `A` and its production are said to be left recursive, because the production `A -> Aα` has `A` itself as the leftmost symbol on the right side.[^4] Repeated application of this production builds up a sequence of `α`'s to the right of `A`, as in Fig. 2.20(a). When `A` is finally replaced by `β`, we have a `β` followed by a sequence of zero or more `α`'s.

[^4]: In a general left recursive grammar, instead of a production `A -> Aα`, the nonterminal `A` may derive `Aα` through intermediate productions.

The same effect can be achieved, as in Fig. 2.20(b), by rewriting the productions for `A` in the following manner, using a new nonterminal `R`:

```fsharp
A  -> β R 
R  -> α R | ε
```

Nonterminal `R` and its production `R -> αR` are right recursive because this production for `R` has `R` itself as the last symbol on the right side. Right-recursive productions lead to trees that grow down towards the right, as in Fig. 2.20(b). Trees growing down to the right make it harder to translate expressions containing left-associative operators, such as minus. In Section 2.5.2, however, we shall see that the proper translation of expressions into postfix notation can still be attained by a careful design of the translation scheme.

In Section 4.3.3, we shall consider more general forms of left recursion and show how all left recursion can be eliminated from a grammar.
